# Civilwar_onset_contageous

## Civil war dataset:
UCDP UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset Codebook:  UCDP datasets have always relied on the 25 deaths in a calendar year threshold for inclusion in its datasets. A link to its codebook: chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fucdp.uu.se%2Fdownloads%2Fucdpprio%2Fucdp-prio-acd-211.pdf&clen=292699&chunk=true


After filtering: from 2010-2020, in the African region, we have N=205.


## Unit of analysis:
- event
- maybe safer to look at the news reporting of all the other countries' civil war on the continent


## What does it mean that when news report has positive tone and high volume?
- a little hesitation there: worry about state capacity.
- a way of diffusion: ethnic ties


## Where to find news articles?
- Nexis Unis: https://advance-lexis-com.proxy2.library.illinois.edu/bisacademicresearchhome/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=35473aab-db2c-40f1-8501-d5043ca5e0d8&ecomp=xb3nk&prid=8d2358d0-48d4-4a74-92bc-1712791298da
- Access World Newsbank: https://infoweb-newsbank-com.proxy2.library.illinois.edu/apps/news/browse-multi?p=AWNB&action=browse

**Newsbank contains much more African local news than Nexis Unis. However, news in South Africa and Kenya are over-represented.**


## Example
Keyword: Congo Civil War
Date range: 3/18/2013 - 4/18/2013

Newsbanks's results: South Africa (29), Kenya (5), Zimbabwe (3), Uganda (2). Notice there is no Congo's news article here! I checked Congo's collection starts later than 2013. Then I identified "Le Potentiel" is the leading daily newspaper in DR Congo. No news about the civil war in 2013. Only "La course à l'OIF - L'économie est au cÅ“ur des préoccupations des Etats [analysis]" that show up in both Nexis Unis and Newsbank.
