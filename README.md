# Civilwar_onset_contageous

## Civil war dataset:
UCDP UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset Codebook:  UCDP datasets have always relied on the 25 deaths in a calendar year threshold for inclusion in its datasets. A link to its codebook:chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fucdp.uu.se%2Fdownloads%2Fucdpprio%2Fucdp-prio-acd-211.pdf&clen=292699&chunk=true


After filtering: from 2010-2020, in the African region, we have N=205.


## Unit of analysis:
- event
- maybe safer to look at the news reporting of all the other countries' civil war on the continent


## What does it mean that when news report has positive tone and high volume?
- a little hesitation there: worry about state capacity.
- a way of diffusion: ethnic ties
